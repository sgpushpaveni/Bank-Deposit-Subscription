# Bank-Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Overview
Predict bank clients likely to subscribe to term deposits using ML and explainable AI.

## Structure
- `src/preprocessing.py`: Data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering
- `src/modeling.py`: Baseline and advanced models
- `src/evaluation.py`: Leaderboard, metrics
- `src/explainability.py`: SHAP explainability
- `src/dashboard.py`: Streamlit app

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run preprocessing and modeling scripts to train models
3. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run src/dashboard.py`

## Deployment
Deploy Streamlit app to cloud

## Deliverables
- Cleaned/preprocessed dataset
- Modeling notebooks/scripts
- Leaderboard-style comparison
- SHAP explainability
- Deployed dashboard
